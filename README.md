# C Language Notes

This repository contains my notes on the C programming language. I am currently learning C and these files are my way of keeping track of what I have learned.

The files in this repository are organized by topic. The `basic` folder contains notes on the basics of C, such as variables, data types, and operators. The `functions` folder contains notes on functions, which are reusable blocks of code. The `structures` folder contains notes on structures, which are data types that can be used to group related data together.

I hope these notes are helpful to other people who are learning C.
